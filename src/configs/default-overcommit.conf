# This config is used to set overcommit policy
#
# Format:
# Blank lines and lines beginning with a # are ignored
# Other lines are fed to `sysctl -w' by the `overcommit' init script.

# Use default memory policy, which leaves
# the system susceptible to OOM-kill scenarios.
#
# Heuristic overcommit handling. Obvious overcommits of
# address space are refused. Used for a typical system. It
# ensures a seriously wild allocation fails while allowing
# overcommit to reduce swap usage.  root is allowed to
# allocate slighly more memory in this mode. This is the
# default.
